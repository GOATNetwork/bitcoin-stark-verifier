# bitcoin-stark-verifier

A STARK verifier in Bitcoin Script, using **no `OP_CAT`** and no other disabled
opcode.

| Crate | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`poseidon2`](poseidon2/) | Poseidon2 over KoalaBear — the permutation, the degree-4 extension field, row hashing and Merkle path verification |
| [`whir`](whir/) | The WHIR verifier on top of it — Fiat–Shamir sponge, challenger, sumcheck rounds, multilinear evaluation, query openings, constraint batching and the closing identity |

📄 **[Algorithm and implementation review](docs/whir-review.pdf)** — a formal
account of the STIR and WHIR proximity tests, what this implementation checks,
what it does not, and why. Source: [`docs/whir-review.tex`](docs/whir-review.tex).

```
cargo test                              # everything, 107 tests
cargo test -p whir --test end_to_end    # a real Plonky3 proof, in script
cargo test -p whir --test budget        # what it would cost on-chain
```

## Why no `OP_CAT`

`OP_SHA256` hashes one stack item, while a Merkle step hashes two children
concatenated — so a byte hash needs `OP_CAT`, which is disabled, and re-enabling
it means a soft fork ([BIP-347](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki)
is `Complete` but not deployed).

An **algebraic** hash removes the dependency. A Poseidon2 digest is eight field
elements rather than thirty-two bytes, so compressing two children hands sixteen
field elements to a width-16 permutation — sixteen stack items passed to an
arithmetic routine, with nothing to concatenate. It is also the hash
[Ziren](https://github.com/ProjectZKM/Ziren) commits with.

## What the verifier does

`verifier::verify_and_close` emits the whole schedule and ends on the identity
the protocol exists to reach:

```
claimed_eval == w(R) · f_M(r_fin)
```

Every value in it is derived inside the script. `R` is each round's folding
randomness, accumulated by the sumcheck rounds rather than discarded; `w(R)` is
the accumulated constraints evaluated at `R`; `f_M` is a copy the absorb kept of
the final polynomial, and `r_fin` is the tail of `R`.

Per round the schedule absorbs the commitment, alternates out-of-domain samples
with their answers, opens the round's queries against the **previous** round's
commitment, and runs its sumcheck rounds. Query indices are squeezed from the
sponge, and the index *is* the Merkle path: the spender picks neither which leaf
is opened nor where it sits.

### What is checked

- **Challenges are unchooseable.** Every one is squeezed after the values it
  depends on are absorbed. Supplying them instead is not a shortcut but a
  soundness error of exactly one — the review works out why.
- **An opening is one unit.** The row is bound to its leaf by
  `merkle::hash_row` (Plonky3's `PaddingFreeSponge`, checked against it on a row
  from a real proof), the path recomputes the root, and that root is the
  **absorbed commitment** rather than a value taken from the witness.
- **The closing identity is real.** All four extension coefficients, against a
  claim the transcript produced.

- **The constraints are derived, not supplied.** Each round buries the
  out-of-domain scalars it samples, the shift points its queries produce
  (`domain_gen^index`) and its batching challenge below the folding randomness;
  the closing check lifts them back out and evaluates the whole weight
  polynomial from them. A round costs `1 + n` extension elements to carry rather
  than `n · (1 + arity)`, because its constraints share a challenge and each
  point is the square-power expansion of one scalar.

### What is not

The **statement** is supplied, and always will be: its point is public because
it *is* the claim being proved, and a different point is a different statement
rather than a cheaper proof of the same one.

Three fidelity items remain against Plonky3 in `verify_and_close`, the
proof-independent script whose cost is measured below. It squeezes afresh for
each challenge and reads the rate forward, where Plonky3's `DuplexChallenger`
buffers, pops the rate from the end and serves two extension challenges per
permutation; it carries each round's claim into the next sumcheck without the
per-round answer combination WHIR's decision phase requires; and it treats the
statement and the commit phase's out-of-domain samples as two constraint groups
where Plonky3 batches them under one challenge. Each is resolved in
`proof_script::build`, the proof-bound verifier of the [end-to-end](#end-to-end)
run, which is checked against Plonky3 rather than against this crate's own
reference.


## End to end

`whir/tests/end_to_end.rs` runs [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3)'s
actual WHIR prover over KoalaBear, verifies the proof with **Plonky3's own
verifier**, and then verifies the same proof in Bitcoin Script:
`proof_script::build` emits, for one proof, the script that performs the whole
verification — the transcript on the script's own sponge, every opened row
hashed and walked to its root, the folds, the STIR checks, the weights and the
closing identity — and the test executes it. The script ends with exactly one
true item on the stack, so a valid proof is a valid tapscript spend, and the
test checks that, not only that no opcode failed.

| proof | script | peak stack | transcript permutations |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 variables, no intermediate round | 198.1 MB | 2,596 | 81 |
| 8 variables, one intermediate round | 340.9 MB | 4,555 | 93 |

These are against Plonky3 0.7, whose transcript is layered: the commitment,
each out-of-domain claim, each opening claim, the WHIR run, the batching draw
and every sumcheck delegate seed the sponge with their own domain separator
(a constant of the configuration) before their first interaction, and the
STIR queries are a fixed `num_queries` draws with duplicates kept. The seeds
are what the extra permutations pay for. They belong to the configuration
(`TranscriptConfig::seeds`), and the script pushes them as constants of the
locking script; they are not in the spender's data, since a prover that chose
them would choose the challenges. The test bed reads them off a logged run of
Plonky3's verifier and cross-checks the WHIR one against
`WhirShape::domain_separator`.

A wrong final domain generator, a changed opened row, a changed final
polynomial and a script with a different seed are each rejected.

The script mirrors `reference::verify`, the verifier in plain Rust, and that in
turn is checked against Plonky3 at every layer rather than only at the end:
a logging challenger records the observe/sample sequence Plonky3's verifier
actually executes (every one of its samplers is a trait default over one
primitive `sample()`); `reference::Challenger` and then `reference::transcript`
reproduce it draw for draw; the script transcript ends in Plonky3's own sponge
state; and `reference::verify` accepts the real proofs before the script is
asked to. The native verification comes first on purpose: every other test
compares a script against a Rust reference, which establishes that the two
agree — not that either is right.

Two boundaries. The script is **built from the proof it verifies**, because a
transcript's schedule (STIR queries are drawn until enough are distinct) and the
openings' shape are the proof's; it trusts none of it — every challenge comes
from its own sponge, every draw's rejection and duplicate decision is checked in
script — but a proof-independent fixed script would need that loop unrolled to
a bound with conditional permutations, which no on-chain WHIR verifier avoids.
And the **1000-item stack limit is lifted** for the run: a 35-query proof's
Merkle data alone exceeds it, and a deployment chunks the verification across
transactions (see [Chunks](#chunks)); whether the script verifies is a separate
question from how it is split.

## Measured cost

Everything follows from one constant: a Poseidon2 permutation is **572,228
bytes**, and nothing else is within 1% of it. Each figure below is the length of
a script some test executes.

| | bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| one Poseidon2 permutation | 572,228 |
| one Merkle level | 572,251 *(23 bytes of ordering overhead)* |
| Merkle path at depth 21 | 12,017,295 — **3.0 blocks** |
| `sumcheck_round()` | 95,100 |
| `sumcheck_round_fs()` | 667,539 |
| …keeping its challenge for the closing check | 667,615 — **+76 B, 0.011%** |
| `eval_multilinear(4)` | 358,048 |
| `eq_eval(4)` | 190,780 |
| `constraint_eval`, 10 constraints of arity 8 | 4,053,279 |
| …derived from scalars instead | 5,687,370 — **+40.3%** |
| the whole closing check, example config | 92,801,911 — **7.5%, 0 permutations** |
| **composed sumcheck chain, one real proof** | **8,967,342** |

For the 2²⁰ example configuration — 20 queries, folding factor 4 —
`whir/tests/verifier.rs` reports:

| | permutations |
| --- | ---: |
| Merkle paths | 1,300 |
| leaf hashing | 800 |
| transcript | 62 |
| **total** | **2,162** = 1.24 GB = **309.3 blocks** |
| **query share** | **97.1%** |

Leaf hashing is 37% of that on its own: a row at folding factor 4 is sixteen
extension elements, so sixty-four base elements, so eight permutations per query
on top of the twenty-one the path costs. It buys the binding — without it a
spender could authenticate the committed leaf and fold a different row.

The closing identity is **92,801,911 bytes — 7.5% of the verifier, and no
permutation at all**, evaluating 110 constraints derived from the transcript.
Against a supplied list it is 1.5 MB; deriving is what stops a spender choosing
them. Arithmetic is the cheap part without being a free one.

## Does it fit in a transaction?

No, and the wall is lower than a query. Taproot removed the 10,000-byte script
limit and the 201-opcode cap, so what binds is weight: 400,000 units for a
standard transaction, 4,000,000 for a block, witness bytes counting one each.

**A standard transaction holds 0.70 of a single permutation.** One *hash* does
not fit, let alone one query — which is 3.4 to 4.6 blocks across every
configuration `whir/tests/budget.rs` derives.

Lowering the security level does not change that. It buys **fewer queries, not
cheaper ones**: at 16 variables a query costs the same 13.7 MB at 80 and 100
bits, because depth is set by the domain size and not by λ. What moves is the
total:

| λ | pow | vars | permutations | blocks |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100 | 22 | 16 | 976 | 139.6 |
| 80 | 22 | 16 | 740 | **105.9** |
| 80 | 22 | 20 | 991 | 141.8 |
| 80 | 22 | 24 | 1,249 | 178.7 |

Chunking is therefore not optional, and its unit has to be *sub-query*.

## Chunks

The verifier is never executed on-chain. What can be is one **step** of it, if
the prover commits to the state between steps and a challenger names the step it
claims is wrong — so what matters is the step count and whether a step relays.

A step cannot be one Merkle level (572,252 bytes against 400,000 weight units),
so it has to be sub-permutation. That is less awkward than it sounds: a
permutation is already a chain of rounds, each taking a state and leaving a
state, and `permutation::rounds()` emits them with a test pinning their
composition to `permute()`.

A step also has to be *bound*. A predicate over supplied states decides nothing
about whose claim it is — a spender answers one challenge with one state and the
next with another — so both states come from Winternitz one-time signatures.
Those fit Bitcoin for the same reason the rest of this does: a hash chain only
ever hashes a single item, so `OP_HASH160` suffices and no soft fork is needed.

The Winternitz parameter is forced from above rather than chosen. One chain per
bit is the cheapest thing to verify and does not work: a state is 496 bits, so
505 chains, so **1,010 witness items against Bitcoin's 1,000-item stack limit**
— the script fails before executing an opcode. At `w = 16` a state is 131 chains
and two signatures are 524 items.

The last saving is to commit at *chunk* boundaries rather than every round,
since a challenger only executes the run containing the disputed round:

| | bytes | of a standard tx | commitments per permutation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| one committed round | 94,020 | 23.5% | 29 |
| a **22-round chunk** | 395,916 | 99.0% | **2** |

22 is longer than dividing the budget by a round suggests, because the rounds
differ by 6×: an external round applies the S-box to all sixteen state elements
(50,028 B), an internal round to one (8,434 B), and the eight external rounds
sit at opposite ends so no window of 22 holds more than four. `max_chunk_len`
takes the length whose *worst* window fits, not the budget over the mean.

The 80-bit, 20-variable verifier is then **≈2,000 chunks**, the same order as
BitVM2's own leaf count — and because the commitments *are* the setup, that
figure bounds setup as well as the spend.

**What the count leaves out.** Generating the keys: 2,000 boundaries at 131
chains each is roughly a quarter of a million hash chains, which is the cost
BitVM2 deployments actually struggle with. And the arithmetic between
permutations does not decompose — 2% of the verifier, still 25 MB with no step
boundaries in it, and so not counted in the 2,000.


## Security parameters

`pow_bits: 0` is not a conservative choice; it is a configuration that mostly
does not exist. Neither security level is derivable past a toy instance without
grinding: 100-bit at 16 variables already requires 19 bits, 20 variables
requires 28, and 24 requires 37. Even 80-bit needs 8 bits at 20 variables.
KoalaBear gives log₂(p) = 30.989 and degree 4, so 123.955 bits are available and
the field is never what binds.

The soundness regime is `SecurityAssumption::CapacityBound`, the cheapest of the
three and the only one resting on the unproven half of WHIR's Conjecture 4.12.
Nothing in the implementation mentions a soundness assumption — the script
executes a schedule, and the regime reaches it only as a query count — so the
choice is a config change. `cargo test -p whir --test budget` prices it, giving
each regime the grinding it needs:

| regime | vars | pow | queries | permutations | vs CB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| UD, proved | 16 | 0 | 110 | 7,376 | **7.18×** |
| JB, Conj. 4.12(1) | 16 | 26 | 39 | 1,853 | 1.80× |
| CB, Conj. 4.12(2) | 16 | 19 | 21 | 1,027 | 1.00× |
| UD, proved | 20 | 0 | 110 | 11,171 | **9.01×** |
| JB | 20 | 33 | 35 | 2,222 | 1.79× |
| CB | 20 | 28 | 19 | 1,240 | 1.00× |

UD wants no grinding at all and pays entirely in queries, capped at 110
regardless of size — so the gap widens with the witness rather than staying
fixed. JB wants *more* grinding than CB, which is the direction a weaker
assumption should push. A verifier that settles bitcoin should say out loud
which assumption it stands on, and what the proved one would cost.
