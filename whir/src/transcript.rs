//! The verifier's transcript, emitted as script by the reference transcript.
//!
//! [`crate::reference::transcript`] is the schedule Plonky3's verifier executes,
//! written over a two-method [`Sponge`]. [`Emitter`] is a `Sponge` that emits
//! script: driving the reference transcript through it produces, in one pass,
//! the script that runs that transcript on the sponge state and the values it
//! must draw. The transcript logic lives in one place; this module only turns
//! each primitive into stack operations.
//!
//! # The buffering rule, at generation time
//!
//! Plonky3's `DuplexChallenger` buffers observed elements and permutes when
//! eight are pending or when a sample finds pending input or an empty output
//! buffer; samples then pop the rate from the end. None of that needs runtime
//! bookkeeping in script: the schedule is fixed once the proof's shape is, so
//! the emitter keeps the two buffer counts itself and emits [`sponge::absorb`]
//! exactly where the reference sponge would duplex, and reads exactly the rate
//! slot the reference would pop. The lockstep [`reference::Challenger`] is
//! what makes that claim checkable, value by value.
//!
//! # Stack
//!
//! The sixteen-element state sits on top of the main stack, with the pending
//! inputs (at most seven) above it between an observe and the duplex that
//! consumes them. Observed values arrive from the altstack, one
//! `OP_FROMALTSTACK` each, so the caller pushes the transcript's inputs there
//! in consumption order. In [`Mode::Check`] every sample is compared with the
//! value the reference drew, also taken from the altstack, and the state is
//! left as the reference leaves it; [`stream`](Emitter::stream) is the whole
//! altstack, inputs and expected draws interleaved in the order they are read.
