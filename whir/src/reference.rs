// the sponge with its domain separator (a constant of the configuration)
// before its first interaction. Those seeds are inputs here; the test bed
// reads them off a logged run and cross-checks the WHIR one against the API.

//   2. per commitment OOD sample: its seed, draw the point, absorb the answer
//   3. per opening claim: its seed, draw the point, absorb the evaluations

//   5. the initial sumcheck: its seed, then per round absorb `[c0, c_inf]`,
//      PoW, draw
//   6. per intermediate round: absorb the root; per OOD draw and absorb;
//      PoW; the STIR queries, a fixed `num_queries` uniform draws (every
//      position when the domain is no larger), duplicates kept, in draw

// The WHIR verifier's arithmetic, on top of the transcript.
//
// `WhirVerifier::verify` and the PCS adapter around it, in plain Rust over the
// crate's `u32`/`[u32; 4]` arithmetic. The transcript is run first
// ([`transcript`]); the arithmetic only consumes challenges, never feeds the
// sponge, so the two passes are independent.
//
//   1. Initial constraint. One `Eq` statement per opening claim: each current
//      opening's point is the claim's row point `expand(y, row_vars)` with its
//      column selector's coordinates appended (`PrefixProver` reverses the
//      selectors and lifts them as a suffix). Then one `Eq` statement of
//      the commitment's OOD claims at `expand(y, k)`. Batched by `alpha`:
//      `claim = sum_i alpha^i eval_i` in that order.
//   2. Initial sumcheck: `claim = h(r)` per round.
//   3. Per intermediate round: the previous commitment is opened at the
//      round's queries (Merkle paths from the pruned multi-proof), each row
//      folds to `eval_multilinear(row, previous folding randomness)`, the query
//      index `q` becomes the point `z = g^q`; a new constraint
//      `[Eq(ood), Select(z, folds)]` with challenge `gamma` is combined into
//      the claim -- its powers start at `gamma^1`, the existing claim being
//      the `gamma^0` term (`Constraint::new_with_existing_claim`), which is
//      the paper's `sigma = claim + gamma*y_0 + sum gamma^(j+1) g(z_j)` --
//      then the round's sumcheck runs.
//   4. Final: the last commitment's rows fold likewise and must equal the
//      final polynomial's Horner evaluation at `z`; the final sumcheck runs;
//      with `R` the concatenation of all folding randomness, the weights
//      `w(R) = sum_c sum_i chi_c^i weight_{c,i}(last arity_c coords of R)`
//      and the closing identity `claim == w(R) * eval_multilinear(final, r_fin)`.
//
// `Eq` weights are `eq(point, .)`; `Select` weights are Plonky3's
// `eval_select`, the multilinear extension of `b -> z^b`.
